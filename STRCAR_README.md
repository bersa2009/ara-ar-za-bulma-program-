  - 10,000 km â†’ Oil change
  - 20,000 km â†’ Air filter replacement
- Notifications for upcoming maintenance
- Track overdue and upcoming services

### ðŸ”¹ 7. AraÃ§ Kimlik No (VIN Decoder)
- Reads VIN number from OBD or manual input
- Retrieves vehicle information: model, year, engine type, manufacturing location
- Additional: Service records and recall information display
- Comprehensive vehicle feature listing

### ðŸ”¹ 8. HatalarÄ± Kaydet (Save Reports)
- Saves DTC and sensor data as reports
- Historical reports can be exported as PDF/Excel
- Creates service history
- Report management with filtering and search

### ðŸ”¹ 9. GÃ¼ncelleme (Updates)
